# Advent of Code 2023

This time we are not using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for dependency management, but [Rye](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/rye).

Python Version is 3.12.

## Set up environment
1. Install Rye
2. Run `rye sync`

With this you should have the environment set up.

Since I am quite busy with project at work I doubt that I will be able to manage all days this year.
